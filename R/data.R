#' Example data
#'
#' The example input file infile.txt is made up of 200 diploid individuals genotyped at 12 microsatellite markers,
#' each with 8 alleles. This is an example of a data-set where no information relating to substructure is available.
#' When this data is analysed using hierarchical algorithms, such as Weir and Cockerhamâ€™s (1984), implemented in,
#' for example, GENEPOP (Rousset, 2008), FIS values are output for each locus, with an average of FIS = 0.049 (s.d. = 0.019).
