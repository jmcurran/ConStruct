Description: This package is aimed at helping researchers determine what degree of the apparent "relatedness" in a population is due to high levels of relatedness between individuals (cosanguinuity), and differences (or similarities) induced by subpopulations within the population mainly breeding with each other. Departures from Hardy–Weinberg expectations within a single population are typically quantified by Wright’s inbreeding coefficient: \eqn{FIS}{_F_{IS}} (1951). Discounting null alleles, FIS is a measure of the degree of identity by descent (IBD) between two alleles at a locus within an individual, above that expected through random mating. This extra degree of relatedness between alleles results in an excess of homozygosity relative to Hardy–Weinberg expectations. However, undetected population substructure can also cause an excess of homozygosity. This is referred to as the Wahlund effect, which arises whenever a population is cryptically composed of numerous subpopulations, each experiencing a degree of isolation (Hartl & Clark, 2007). In this latter scenario, the excess of homozygosity is not caused by increased IDB between alleles within individuals relative to the population as a whole, but increased IBD between alleles within subpopulations relative to the total population. This occurs whenever there are barriers to gene flow between the subpopulations such that the ensuing genetic drift causes the allele frequency distributions within subpopulations to diverge, which is typically measured by another of Wright’s inbreeding coefficients: \eqn{FST}{F_{ST}}.
